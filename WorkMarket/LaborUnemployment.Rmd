Here we look at the quarterly non-farm labor producivity in America since 1948 and compare it to the quarterly non-farm unemployment rate. Both data sets are from the Beuru of Labor Statistics. The labor productivity is the percent change from the previous quarter. 
```{r, plot, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data = read.csv("labor.csv", header = TRUE)
data=data.frame(data)
##Setting up a basic bar chart for labor producviity change and line graph for the unemployment rate
a = ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Time, y = Productivity, ymax = 25, ymin = -15, color=Productivity)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") 
a = a + geom_line(data=data, aes(x=Time, y=Unemployment, group= 1), colour="red")

##We can now shade in the recessions on the graph. Dates are from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States. Start and ending dates are rounded to the nearest quarter

Start = c("1948-10-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-07-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-10-01", "1973-10-01", "1980-01-01", "1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-04-01", "2008-01-01") 
End =   c("1949-10-01", "1954-04-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-01-01", "1970-10-01", "1975-04-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-10-01", "1991-04-01", "2001-10-01", "2009-07-01")
Recessions <- data.frame(xmin=Start, xmax=End, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf)

a = a + geom_rect(data=Recessions, aes(xmin=xmin, xmax=xmax, ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax), alpha=0.5, inherit.aes = FALSE)

a + ggtitle("Labor Productivity in US and Unemployment Rate") + xlab("Quarters from 1948-20015") + ylab("%Change in Labor Producivity from Previous Quarter, Unemployment Rate %")
