Dear Human Resources,

I would like to express my interest in the Junior Media Analyst position. This role is the perfect marriage between my creative and analytical skills and my interest in data analysis. That marriage coupled with my desire to work in a challenging and fast-pace environment will ensure I succeed at Vivaki.

I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor’s of Engineering in Nuclear Engineering. My engineering courses and my job as a teaching assistant gave me a strong background in Microsoft Excel and programming in languages such as MATLAB. To enhance my skills, I am currently taking the online Coursera Data Science specialization and Machine Learning class. My current position as a Nuclear Engineer with the State of Wisconsin has improved my teamwork and investigative skills. Some of my responsibilities include inspecting the performance of companies that utilize radioactive material. I am also revising state regulatory guides and collaborating on a working group that created a process for new employee onboarding that will be rolled out to a 300 employee department.

I constantly challenge myself to improve upon my talents. I am teaching myself R, T-SQL and always embrace the opportunity to learn something new. In my class groups, I always tended to lead the group making the critical decisions after examining our goals, results, timeline and receiving input from other members. I hope to bring my skills and aptitudes to Vivaki when given the opportunity. 
 
I look forward to talking with you regarding an interview. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,



David Lara
